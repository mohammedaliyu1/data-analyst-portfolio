# Monthly Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project presents a Power BI dashboard analyzing monthly sales performance to identify trends, seasonality, and the relationship between order volume and revenue. The dashboard is designed to support quick performance monitoring and data-driven decision-making.
## Business Objective
The objective of this analysis is to identify key sales drivers, assess revenue losses, and provide insights that can support data-driven business decisions.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains monthly retail sales data including:
- Total Orders
- Gross Sales
- Discounts
- Returns
- Net Sales
- Shipping
- Total Sales
- Month Index

## Tools Used
- Power BI
- DAX
- Data Cleaning & Data Modeling

## Data Preparation
- Standardized month values
- Created a Month Index column for correct chronological sorting
- Validated data types for all numerical fields

## Analysis Performed
- Seasonal sales performance analysis by month
- Revenue composition analysis (gross sales vs discounts and returns)
- Order volume vs sales value comparison
- Shipping cost efficiency analysis

## Key Insights
Sales exhibit clear month-to-month variation, indicating seasonality.
Months with higher order volumes generally correspond to higher total sales.
Certain months show stronger revenue without proportional increases in orders, suggesting higher average order values.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to clean raw data, build meaningful visualizations, and derive actionable business insights using Power BI.
